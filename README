Virtual Telescope

Download the tarfile called virtual_telescope.tar, and unpack it.  Running the code will generate any required sub-directories and populate them with subsequent files.

Copy entire contents of:

/net/polaris/u/steinb/virtual_telescope

including the sub-directories and their contents to a directory with more than
100 Mb free disk space.

You will need IDL along with the astro-lib programs in order to run the code.

Go to the directory and run IDL.

>idl

Compile as.

>.run virtual_telescope.pro

Then run it.

>virtual_telescope
