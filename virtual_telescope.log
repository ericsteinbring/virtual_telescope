Virtual Telescope

Logbook:

started: 4/11/1998  
Work begins on the first version of the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST)
Visible Imager (VI) and Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) simulation software.
This work was funded under two contracts. The first was through the National
Research Council Canada (NRC) as an employee of the Herzberg Institute of
Astrophysics (HIA). The idea was based on a suggestion of David Crampton of HIA
that a simulation of spectroscopy be built to better understand the issues of
multi-object spectroscopy from space. These would be background subtraction, 
contamination of sources, crowding, etc. Similarily, at the suggestion of 
Paul Hickson of the University of British Columbia (UBC) a simulation of an
imager was built. The idea was to find the advantages of the better resolution
at short wavelengths afforded by a separate imager than the near-infrared
camera. This second contract was through UBC. Both were made via funding from
the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).

First version of NGST MOS is available.

Now has a more realistic distribution of galaxies. It distributes them with a
redshift dependent correlation length. The fainter galaxies are redistributed
to higher redshift and fainter magnitudes in order to match an extrapolation of
the HST data. There are now some galaxies with redshifts up to 20. The
spectrograph now has an efficiency curve, although it is a flat 65% over 1 to 5
microns. The galaxy radius is also output at the end of  the simulation.

completed: 23/3/1999
Survey mode is now implemented. Now, you can automatically take spectra of all
galaxies of a certain magnitude by setting the flag magnitude. Instead of
selecting an individual galaxy, use 'Multiplex Mode'. The program will output
information about each spectrum taken. Note, the parameters for each spectra
are the same and are based on the parameters that are set when you initiate
survey mode.

completed: 30/3/1999
The artificial image now goes to magnitude 33 instead of 31. The simulation is
also capable of resolutions up to R=10000. However, the galaxy template spectra
are still grainy (R=2000) so this will need to be fixed. The change in PSF
(diffraction limit) with wavelength is implemented. The simulation also outputs
an image of the spectrum for a slit and fiber spectrograph in survey mode.

completed: 5/4/1999
The control panel has been updated so that all aspects of the code can be
manipulated by the user. The cloned galaxies, now as faint as magnitude 34,
are also given a random rotation before they are added to the field. New
template spectra are used. They have a maximum resolution of R=20000 and have
a large number of emission lines.

completed: 18/6/1999
The problem of incorrect pixel sampling has been corrected. Now, although the
simulation always uses 40 X 40 pixel sections to perform calculations, it is
always selecting a 27 X 27 (2 arcsec X 2 arcsec) section from the original 
image. This is 0.075 arcsec/pixel resolution in the original HST NICMOS image,
but the output is now 40 X 40 pixels (0.05 arcsec X 0.05 arcsec). The background
model is no longer normalized to the NICMOS image and can be varied. The program
now simulates four different slit arrangement options. It can perform a
multiplexed observation using a slit mask such as a laser-cut mask or a
micromachined mirror array, positioned fibers, "slit-bands", or micromachined
shutters. Improvements to the virtual NIR camera have also been made. It now
performs as though the spectrograph is wide open and the beam passes straight
through. Previously, the beam was arriving in the camera via the grating. The
photometry is now correct.

completed: 28/6/1999
The simulation now has a visible imager incorporated into it. It uses much the
same code as for the infrared imager. The spectral information and PSF
information is different however and is at very low spectral resolution. The
pixel sampling is variable for both detectors.

completed: 27/7/1999
The simulation now has an image slicer mode. A 2.0 arcsec X 4.0 arcsec region is
sliced by a user-specified number of slices. An analysis package for the visible
and infrared imagers is also incorporated. Work ends on the first version of
NGST VI/MOS. The results are available through various publications including
the author's PhD thesis as well as reports submitted to the NRC, CSA, and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

completed: 28/1/2000
Work begins on a third contract. This is funded from HIA through John Hutchings.
The goal is to study the parameter space of the VI using the software package
and find optimal specifications. A few changes to the software will be made.
Some are cosmetic, such as the display panels. The PSF generation routines will
be improved to allow worse Strehl-ratios than are currently available.  

completed: 2/2/2000
Four full days spent on improving the interface. The final survey results now 
have all of the important parameters listed. There is a zoom function on the
main display panel. The user can simply hit zoom, click on the part of the
screen with the left mouse button to zoom in, and then quit by clicking with
the right mouse button. I don't plan on fixing the scaling on the display. All
of the images are output to 'ngstvimos_results'. The user should open an
SAOImage or an Ximtool to display these. This is much as it would be on a real
observing run anyway.

completed: 4/4/2000
Four full days spent on solving the problem of the PSF being undefined if the
mirror roughness is too great. This was a simple math problem. It took the
exponetial of too large a number. Basically, it was roundoff error. This is
solved by using the scattering method as before except now this PSF is smoothed
one last time before the Strehl ratio is calculated. It makes some sense. Can
be considered an error associated with the telescope optics. It is implemented
as a Gaussian smoothing function but can be switched to a boxcar to increase
program speed. It is controlled by the `optics error' slider in the Telescope
display.

Begin work on performing the DRM proposals in detail. Will compare directly
the VI and MOS imager on galaxy and star fields. Took a day to test the 
simulation on automated surveys of galaxies and stars. Also ran it to test a
a WWW-code run of all galaxies down to magnitude 30. Took over two days and
was only about half done. This was for 10 X 1000 second exposures at poor pixel
sampling for both the VI and MOS. This seems to make it impossible to run the
simulation in WWW mode to do this experiment. It will take too long and will
have to be done in real-time mode.

completed: 1/11/2000
The simulation has been pared down in resolution and expanded in generality.
It includes the choice of four pupils and the effects of the atmosphere on
both PSF and throughput. The ground-based background is included. No other
major changes have been made. This work took approximately 3 weeks.
