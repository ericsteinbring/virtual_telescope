Virtual Telescope 

Program Overview:

This tool is designed to simulate a telescope along with
instruments. An artificial field is generated that is deep
enough to test the capabilities of the NGST. The telescope
itself, its PSF and background for ground/space is then 
simulated. It uses images from the HST NICMOS Deep Field
South and photometric redshift survey data on the galaxies
in this field to  generate artificial deep galaxy fields.
It uses HST WFPC2 data in M15 and NGC 5457 to generate
artificial NGST star fields. It utilizes a model for the 
background illumination consisting of a scattered and 
thermal component of the zodiacal light. The ground-based
background is an observed one. The background due to the
thermal emission of the telescope is estimated. It has 
spectra of four different galaxy types, E/S0, Sbc, Scd, 
and Irr which are redshifted according to the photometric
redshift catalog. An artificial galaxy of each type is
generated. The field galaxies are generated by spreading
these template galaxy images over the range of 1 to 5
microns according to the resulting SEDs. All major aspects
of the instruments are simulated. Filters are given by
the the response curves from the HST WFPC2 and HST NICMOS.
The spectrograph grating has a specified efficiency curve.
The detectors are also simulated and include dark current,
readout, non-linearity, and shot-noise. You can select
a particular galaxy for study from the resulting artificial
deep field and perform imaging, image-slicing or slit
spectroscopy on it. The slit size, resolution, exposure 
duration, and extraction of the spectra can be manipulated.
The result is a realistic image or extracted spectrum which
can be analyzed in a similar manner as with any real 
telescope data. Diagnostic numbers are output, such as the
surface brightness of the galaxy as well as S/N and 
resolution of the extracted spectra. 

Field Initialization:

The first step is to initialize the simulation. After 
setting the appropriate values for the artificial field
generation press 'Initialize'. Selecting appropriate values
requires some practice. To start, you probably want to run
the simulation with the defaults. The program will read in
HST images, the photometric redshift information (obtained
from the SUNY website), the template galaxy spectra 
(obtained from Steve Gwyn), and a solar spectrum (obtained
from NSO/Kitt Peak FTS data). The simultion generates the 
artificial NGST field by taking the faint objects from the
HST field (say, F1600W(AB) > 25), shifting them fainter by 
a few magnitudes, to a factor higher in redshift, making 
them smaller, and then putting them back into the field in 
random locations and rotations. Note, however, that the 
positions are not entirely random. The objects are 
preferentially put down (according to a normal 
distribution) next to other galaxies within a specified  
'correlation length'. The correlation length here is the 
FWHM (in arcseconds) of the normal distribution. This 
simulates the projected spatial 'clumpiness' of a real 
distribution. You can make the field as clumpy or smooth 
as desired. The simulation actually puts several 'clones' 
back in the field for each faint galaxy to extend source
counts at faint magnitudes. Check the statistics on the 
fields using 'Show Setup'. 

Telescope Initialization:

Choose on of the four possible designs as well as a
temperature and other parameters such as mirror roughness.
The background is calculated using a model that 
includes a scattered and thermal component of the zodiacal
light (by Simon Morris based on Wheelock et al. 1994). In 
this simulation, however, the scattered component is 
multiplied by the observed NIR solar spectrum to simulate 
the effects of solar absorption features. The ground-based
background is an observed one from Keck ESI spectra 
provided by Nicolas Cardiel. The diffraction pattern is
smoothed by a Gaussian to simulate the uncorrected error in
the wavefront. This might require several simulations to
obtain observations with a varying PSF over the field. You
can view information concerning the initialization of the 
telescope by pressing 'Show Setup'.

Target Selection:

Once initialized, the entire artificial field is available
for study. Now, Press 'Select Target' to display the 
artificial deep field. You can simply click on the desired 
galaxy. Note that once you press 'Select Target' the 
simulation will wait until you select a target and will not
respond until you do so. The galaxy field can be observed 
with imaging, image-slicing, and slit-spectroscopy modes. 
Only imaging is available for the star field.

Imaging:

You can take broadband filter images of the galaxy and star
fields with either the visible imager or the infrared 
imager mode of the spectrograph. The filters are those of
the HST WFPC2 and HST NICMOS instruments. Set the 
parameters of the camera and choose a primary filter. Press
'Expose' to begin integrations. Remember that the detector
is quite realistic and will saturate on bright objects. If
you are not interested in the bright objects you can 
overcome this by setting the well-depth to, say, 32 bits. 
Note that after each observation with the imaging mode the
latest observation is available as a FITS image in the 
directory 'ngstvimos_results'.  You can take a survey of 
the field by choosing a 'Primary' and 'Comparison' filter.
By pressing 'Take Survey' the program will take an exposure
in the primary and comparison filter in 3 different 
randomly chosen positions in the field. To see the results
simply press 'Show Results'. If you want to see colours for
two different filters simply choose these filters as 
primary and comparison and press 'Show Results'.

Performing Spectroscopy:

Once a galaxy has been selected you can set the per-pixel
resolution, width of slit, and exposure duration. Note that
resolution sets the speed of the simulation. Using R=200 
will take only a few seconds on a faster Sun or PC but 
R=5000 will require several minutes in run-time. Press 
'Expose' to run the simulation. The simulated detector will
integrate the spectrum in the specified subexposures, dark
current, and readout noise per exposure. An image of the 
total light through the spectrograph, the raw spectrum, and
background subtracted spectrum are shown. Since the galaxy
is probably not centred perfectly on the slit and since 
several targets may be within the same slit the target 
position can be varied. Note that the extracted region is 
shown in dotted lines overplotted on a slice of the 
spectrum perpedicular to the dispersion. The final spectrum
and extracted spectrum is shown.

Multiplex Mode:

You can automatically take spectra of all galaxies of a 
certain magnitude by setting the flag magnitude. Instead of
selecting an individual galaxy, use 'Multiplex Mode'. The 
program will output information about each spectrum taken 
into a file called 'survey_logfile'. Note, the parameters 
for each spectra are the same and are those which were set
when multiplex mode was initiated. Finally, you can view 
the output of the simulated spectrograph detector. The 
results for both a slit-mask spectrograph (either 
reflective or transmissive) and a fiber-fed are simulated.
For output of the detector press 'Show Spectrum'. To see 
how efficiently the masks were employed and how efficiently
the detector was covered press 'Show Footprint'. Pressing
'Statistics' will give a plot of S/N versus magnitude for 
all of the survey galaxies.
